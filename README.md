NOTE THAT THIS IS STILL A BIG WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
the controls for keybord are as follows:
like in undertale: Z or ENTER to confirm
as any undertale fangame you could run in were x (but not x) and: Shift to run
THIS GAME IS MADE WITH RPG MAKER MV...???
 x for menu
 
 changes i will add:
 I WILL ADD A START MENU: WITH THE EXACT REPLICA OF UNDERTALES JOYSTICK CONFIG, WICH IS GAMEPAD ONLY!!!!
 A MENU FOR CHOOSING THE CURRENT OR UNDERTALE'S KEYBOARD CONTROLS
AND I WILL ADD SOME SERIOUS UNDERTALE STYLE BATTLES (but only bosses for the next update!!!)
FINAL UPDATE FOR 2020 WILL CONTAIN A COMPLETE CHAPTER 1 AND (Possibly) CHAPTER 2
MERCH FOR 2021 WILL BE A COLLECTORS EDITION, SOUNDTRACK AND PS2 AND NINTENDO DS AND SWITCH VERSION (made in microsoft visual studio
(don't expect it to be that good as the original one with my VERY LITTLE rpg maker expirience, so why would i be able to work from scratch
(RPG Maker is built in, and i don't have space at my PC to download gamemaker: studio for these non-PC ones or unity,
esoecially cause unity's free pack needs 5.1GB, and i have 1.2GB)))
